# StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization

This is the implementation of the approaches described in the paper:
> Emanuele Bugliarello, Hernan Moraldo, Ruben Villegas, Mohammad Babaeizadeh, Mohammad Taghi Saffar, Han Zhang, Dumitru Erhan, Vittorio Ferrari, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Paul Voigtlaender. StoryBench: A Multifaceted Benchmark for Continuous Story Visualization. 2023.

We provide our text annotations, guidelines for human evaluation, and the code for computing automatic metrics.

## Data

[`data/`](data/) contains the evaluation data for StoryBench.
- [`data/llm_outputs/`](data/llm_outputs/) contains the captions split by our instruction-tuned LLM
- [`data/tasks/`](data/tasks/) contains the evaluation data formatted for the StoryBench tasks of `action_exe`, `story_cont` and `story_gen`

Training data can be dowloaded from the following links:
- [didemo-train](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/didemo-train.json): original DiDeMo data
- [oops-train_pipeline](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/oops-train_pipeline.json): original VidLN caption as well as algorithmically generated stories
- [oops-train_pipeline+traces](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/oops-train_pipeline+traces.json): same as above plus mouse traces from VidLN
- [uvo_dense-train_pipeline](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/uvo_dense-train_pipeline.json): original VidLN caption as well as algorithmically generated stories
- [uvo_dense-train_pipeline+traces](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/uvo_dense-train_pipeline+traces.json): same as above plus mouse traces from VidLN
- [uvo_sparse-train_pipeline](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/uvo_sparse-train_pipeline.json): original VidLN caption as well as algorithmically generated stories
- [uvo_sparse-train_pipeline+traces](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/uvo_sparse-train_pipeline+traces.json): same as above plus mouse traces from VidLN

While human-annotated evaluation files are recommended (see ['metrics/data/'](metrics/data/)), we also share our automatically generated Oops validation data, which we used to assess the robustness of our data transformation pipeline:
- [oops-valid_pipeline](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/oops-valid_pipeline.json): original VidLN caption as well as algorithmically generated stories
- [oops-valid_pipeline+traces](https://storage.googleapis.com/storybench/oops-valid_pipeline+traces.json): same as above plus mouse traces from VidLN


## Metrics
[`metrics/`](metrics/) contains the source code to perform automatic evaluation of generated videos.

To set up your Python virtual environment, run:
```bash
pip install -r metrics/requirements.txt
```

To compute a given metric (e.g., FID with InceptionV3) run as follows:
```bash
MODEL_NAME="phenaki"
TASK="action_exe"  # [action_exe, story_cont, story_gen]
DATA_SPLIT="oops_test"  # [{oops,uvo,didemo}_{val,test}]
DATA_DIR="/tmp/datadir/"
OUT_DIR="/tmp/out/"

python3 -m metrics.fid_inception --batch_size=256 --model="ground_truth" --task=${TASK} --dataset=${DATA_SPLIT} --data_dir=${DATA_DIR} --output_dir=${OUT_DIR} --num_videos=1

python3 -m metrics.fid_inception --batch_size=256 --model=${MODEL_NAME} --task=${TASK} --dataset=${DATA_SPLIT} --data_dir=${DATA_DIR} --output_dir=${OUT_DIR} --num_videos=4
```

In this example, we run the same script twice, first to extract the features from the ground-truth videos, and then to extract the features from the videos generated by a text-to-video model (`phenaki` here).
Note that we set `--num_videos=4` in the latter case as we sample four videos per text prompt when we generate videos with our models.

If you do not use our extracted features (see above), you only need to run the first script (to extract ground-truth features) once.

The input data to the scripts are `npz` files with the (ground-truth or generated) `video` as a NumPy array.

We rely on publicly available models and code to compute our automatic metrics.
For reference, our working directory is structured as follows.

Note that:
- checkpoints can be downloaded from the corresponding repositories (see [`metrics/third_party/`](metrics/third_party/)):
    - [DOVER](https://github.com/VQAssessment/DOVER)
    - [InternVideo](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo)
    - [pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
- after extracting the features for the ground-truth data, we move them from their `${OUT_DIR}` to the `features/` directory under `${DATA_DIR}`
