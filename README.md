This is the implementation of the approaches described in the paper:

We provide our text annotations, guidelines for human evaluation, and the code for computing automatic metrics.


## Metrics
[`metrics/`](metrics/) contains the source code to perform automatic evaluation of generated videos.

To set up your Python virtual environment, run:
```bash
pip install -r metrics/requirements.txt
```

To compute a given metric (e.g., FID with InceptionV3) run as follows:
```bash
MODEL_NAME="phenaki"
TASK="action_exe"  # [action_exe, story_cont, story_gen]
DATA_SPLIT="oops_test"  # [{oops,uvo,didemo}_{val,test}]
DATA_DIR="/tmp/datadir/"
OUT_DIR="/tmp/out/"

python3 -m metrics.fid_inception --batch_size=256 --model="ground_truth" --task=${TASK} --dataset=${DATA_SPLIT} --data_dir=${DATA_DIR} --output_dir=${OUT_DIR} --num_videos=1

python3 -m metrics.fid_inception --batch_size=256 --model=${MODEL_NAME} --task=${TASK} --dataset=${DATA_SPLIT} --data_dir=${DATA_DIR} --output_dir=${OUT_DIR} --num_videos=4
```

In this example, we run the same script twice, first to extract the features from the ground-truth videos, and then to extract the features from the videos generated by a text-to-video model (`phenaki` here).
Note that we set `--num_videos=4` in the latter case as we sample four videos per text prompt when we generate videos with our models.

If you do not use our extracted features (see above), you only need to run the first script (to extract ground-truth features) once.

The input data to the scripts are `npz` files with the (ground-truth or generated) `video` as a NumPy array.

We rely on publicly available models and code to compute our automatic metrics.
For reference, our working directory is structured as follows.

Note that:
- checkpoints can be downloaded from the corresponding repositories (see [`metrics/third_party/`](metrics/third_party/)):
    - [DOVER](https://github.com/VQAssessment/DOVER)
    - [InternVideo](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo)
    - [pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
- after extracting the features for the ground-truth data, we move them from their `${OUT_DIR}` to the `features/` directory under `${DATA_DIR}`
